I use oh-my-zsh for overall zshrc management.

    zshenv, zprofile, zlogin, and zlogout files are managed here,
        in the "zsh" directory

    zshenv: setup basic envrionment.
    zlogin: nearly nothing. Setup key env vars for launchd
            (may want to duplicate/move to zshrc)
    zlogout: do nothing

    zshrc: use oh-my-zhsrc

Other shells, config is "bash" and "csh" directories:

    bash: interactive sessions restart to zsh.
    csh: swtich to bash (which switches to zsh) if login and interactive.

Other directories:

    emacs: emacs config files (.emacs.d)
    fonts: fonts I want to install on most platforms I use. For Linux in particular,
           the fonts/fonts.symlink is linked to ${HOME}/.fonts.
    modules: config files for ADI Modules system
    tmux: config file for tmux
    X11: X11 config files
